                <p>The first proper site I ever made was a re-make of the dummy game studio site I had made for college at Bray Institute of Further Education. 
                </p>

                <p>I redesigned the whole thing and added a couple of things that weren’t in the original, mainly the modals for the games that I still use in my current site and the image slider at the top.
                </p>

                <p>This was my first experience of making a site that I had fully 
                   intended to go live.</p>

                <p>The first site I did deploy was the previous version of my portfolio website. When I was first starting out in Web Development, I wanted a one-page portfolio/interactive CV kind of website and I believe I achieved this effect.
                </p>

                <p>The site was fully designed in Photoshop and was the first experience I had in Mobile-First design. I marked up the mobile version of the website on Photoshop to begin with, and then made a desktop version of it that I could work off when coding the site.
                </p>

                <p>I learned a lot making this website and picked up a lot of tips and tricks thanks to it that let me improve the websites I made in the future.</p>

                <p>My first commercial venture as an independent Web Developer was working on the recently-completed website for my sister’s start-up company: Accessible Adventures.
                </p>

                <p>I was approached to take on the project and completed it within a month. In this time I made several changes to the original idea (All designed on paper then in Photoshop) to make the website as sleek and good-looking as possible.
                </p>

                <p>The site is fully responsive and uses HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript with JQuery.</p>
