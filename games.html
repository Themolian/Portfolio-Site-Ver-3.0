                <p>The current version of the game sees the player going through a candy-land controlling Cater the Cookie as he traverses the Sweet-Sweet Skyway.</p>

                <p>The game is an endless runner that makes the player think effectively in terms of timing in order to avoid the many hazards present in the game. 
                </p>

                <p>It’s a fun little platformer that I took 3 months to put together and is my proudest work so far.</p>

                <p>Cookie Catastrophe was also the first game I made specifically with mobile users in mind.</p>

                <p>This game started off as a group project during my college days in Bray Institute of Further Education.
                </p>

                <p>Over the game's development, I was able to develop the idea to the point where I could confidently point to it as something I built.
                </p>

                <p>Illusionary Generations was my first real research project. Since the game is based around the dreams of different age-groups, I did a lot of research into constant dream patterns among the ages. This gave me a taste for information gathering, which has fuelled a lot of my current ventures.</p>

                <p>It was also my first crack at a 2D Platformer, and overall I was happy with how it turned out.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Since it was built in the Blender Game Engine, it was my first experience with game logic and logic blocks. This gave me a taste for finding out what made my favourite games work.
                </p>

                <p>This was the first project I had full creative freedom over as well. I built all of the art assets myself, giving me my first experience of proper design in terms of both art and game mechanics.</p>

                <p>As it was my first project in my first year of college, I'm rather pleased with it.</p>

                <p>As of the writing of this post, I am currently creating a Pokémon Battle Simulator written entirely in C++ as a way for me to understand the language and have fun doing it. So far I have gotten a working battle system in the scenario of one battle against the player's Rival. I plan to include features to name the Rival, to level up Pokemon and add more to the party as well as the ability to use items in battle.</p>

                <p>Earl Grey's Marvelous Par-tea, truly a marriage of my two favourite things. Games and awful puns. This in-progress game follows the progress of a stuffy old Englishman named 'Earl Grey' as he sets out to collect all types of tea the world has to offer. On his journey he must defeat the lackeys of the evil Boss-Tonne to complete his collection of tasty leaf water.</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>HanaKotoba has been a while in the making. Originally starting life as an idea for a visual novel that I thought I would never make, having studied and played around with the SFML library of C++, I have finally begun development on it. The story follows a male protagonist as he meets the five heroines of the story at University, whose tales can all be discovered through decision trees and strategic wooing.</p>
