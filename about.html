                <p>My most recent venture into the tech industry has been in the field of Web Design &amp; Development.</p>

                    <p>This is a discipline I fell in love with during my studies at Bray Institute of Further Education.</p>
                    
                    <p>So far I have succeeded in making a website for my sisterâ€™s startup business and my own portfolio website, both of which have been fantastic learning experiences for me.</p>
                    
                    <p>Being mostly self-taught, I have devoted myself heartily to my studies and have gotten a good knowledge in:</p>
                    <p>
                    - HTML
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    - CSS/SASS
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    - PHP

                <p>My first experience in programming and my first legitimate creative venture was Game Design &amp; Development.</p>

                    <p>This is another discipline I fell in love with during my studies at Bray Institute of Further Education. </p>
                    
                    <p>During my time at BIFE and onwards, I have so-far made four games and am currently in the process of making three. Over this time I have learned the work that goes into making a 
                    project of this nature and the sacrifices and scope you have to make in order to create a successful product. </p>
                    
                    <p>I have also taken part in a selection of Game Jams both during my time in the United Kingdom and in Ireland. The most 
                    notable of which was my participation in the iTag hackathon of 2016 in which me and my team were awarded second place.</p>

                <p>My first ever Hackathon was the i&lt;tag&gt; 
                    hackathon in 2016. During this event I had my first taste of what a game-jam could be like. Working solidly for 48 hours in a team of strangers to get a working product created. My team placed second</p>

                <p>During my time in Bray Institute of Further Education, I was fortunate enough to have my work featured at open-days and general events promoting the course I was on. Examples of this work can be found on the Games section of this website.</p>
